# Belly Button Biodiversity – Cataloguing Bacteria and the Quest for Synthetic Meat

## Overview
In the interests of assisting and accelerating the processes of using bacteria to synthesize the proteins found in meat, researchers have been cataloguing data pertaining to the bacterial species found within the belly buttons of individuals participating in a clinical trial.  The purpose of this project was to create a “web page dashboard” where the “ID” of a specific individual could be selected and a bar graph displaying the 10 most common bacteria found in their belly button, a gauge indicating their frequency of belly button scrubbing and a bubble chart displaying the relative amounts of all bacterial species found in their belly button would be displayed.  It was predicted that the programming of such a dashboard would present some challenges and that the overall product, owing to the specifics of the design requests, would be of limited value given the overall project objectives.

## Results
The requested/described dashboard was designed using javascript and, via HTML, presented as a web page which can be accessed at the following location:

 https://scruffy-bearie.github.io/BBB2/

## Analysis
Wherein the page produced meets the design requirements specified in the project outline, the researcher/analyst believes that the usefulness of the website is limited given the objectives of the overall project.  It seems like it would have been far more useful to design a dashboard that allowed one to search on a given bacterial species for sake of identifying those individuals in which the particular species was found along with a summary of the relative bacterial counts.  As such, it would have been possible, had a candidate bacterial species been identified, to determine if that species were present among individuals participating in the trial.
